# Pocota table

Pocota tables is a React 17 responsive table component, that supports a native HTML
like experience when creating tables. The output is a simple pure HTML table, that
you can style to your own likings.

Pocota can be combined with all sorts of React tools for supporting infinite scroll,
sorting, customizable theming, etc. But this library doesn't provide any of this in
itself, it provides a simple and straight forward way of making HTML tables,
for people who prefer to write their markups as markup, and not as an entangled
mess of data-structures.
